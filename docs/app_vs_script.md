# CLI App vs Scripts

## I created cli app with while loop and commands installed by pip. But maybe it is overkill since each script can be lunch from powershell wit argparse or something and that seems simpler.

You're absolutely right that there are trade-offs between having a centralized CLI app and using independent scripts with `argparse` or similar tools. Here are some considerations for each approach:

### **Centralized CLI App**

**Pros:**

1. **Single Entry Point:** Users only need to remember one command to interact with your tool, e.g., `myapp` followed by subcommands.
2. **Consistency:** You can enforce a consistent interface, help messages, and error handling.
3. **Extendable:** New commands can be added easily without cluttering the filesystem with individual scripts.
4. **Integration:** Shared configurations, logging, and dependencies can be managed centrally.

**Cons:**

1. **Overhead:** Building and maintaining a centralized app might feel like overkill for simple tasks.
2. **Complexity for Simple Use Cases:** Users might find it cumbersome to type subcommands for tasks that could be standalone scripts.
3. **Dependency Management:** It may require packaging all the commands as part of a single app, increasing the installation size and setup complexity.

### **Independent Scripts**

**Pros:**

1. **Simplicity:** Each script can focus on doing one task well without the need for integration.
2. **Easy Execution:** Users can invoke scripts directly, e.g., `python my_script.py --option value`.
3. **Lower Barrier to Entry:** No need to install a CLI app; just use Python with the required dependencies.
4. **Modular:** Easier to distribute or update individual scripts without affecting others.

**Cons:**

1. **Fragmentation:** Each script might develop its own style of handling arguments, which can confuse users.
2. **Repetition:** Common functionality (e.g., logging, configuration parsing) might need to be duplicated across scripts.
3. **Scaling Issues:** Managing many scripts becomes cumbersome if they grow in number.

### **Recommendations**

-   **If the scripts are simple** and don’t share much functionality, go with standalone scripts. Use `argparse` to provide command-line options and arguments.
-   **If you foresee significant integration or growth**, a centralized CLI app (using something like `click`, `typer`, or `argparse` with subcommands) can provide long-term benefits.

### **Hybrid Approach**

You can also combine both approaches:

1. Start with standalone scripts.
2. Later, create a centralized CLI app that acts as a wrapper for these scripts. It can invoke them internally or just list them for the user.

This way, you don’t have to decide upfront but can grow into a more sophisticated structure as needed.
